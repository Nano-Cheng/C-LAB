Beep.exe is an auxiliary utility, that will produce 5 beeps. 

It is intended for use in the Clarity Chromatography Station in the Event Table as a tool providing acoustic signalization of performed action (e.g. exceeded limits, etc.).

Beeps are produced using the onboard speaker, which makes the sound independent on soundcard. 

That means that it will produce the sound even if the soundcard is muted, plugged into the earphones or if it is not installed at all!

It is recommended to test its proper function before using it in the event table (e.g. by double-clicking the beep.exe in any file manager).

Some computers may have the onboard speaker disconnected or redirected to the soundcard.
