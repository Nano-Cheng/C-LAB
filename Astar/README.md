This folder contains four parts: automation platform operation software, automation scripts, A* algorithm code, and data for Astar code execution.

1. InLab Solution
This project is an installation package for automation platform software.

2. Automated Script
This project includes all automation scripts related to the synthesis and characterization of nanomaterials (mth files or pzm files). To run the corresponding files, the mth files or pzm files need to be placed in the following path of the software: :\InLab Solution\Resource\System Method

3. Code
This project includes A * algorithm code for optimizing synthesis parameters of Au NRs, Au NSs, and Ag NCs.

4. Data
This project includes synthesis parameter files and UV-Vis data for Au NRs, Au NSs, and Ag NCs. This part of the data is available for algorithm execution.
